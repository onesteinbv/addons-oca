The module adds a Preview column in the Journal Items list (account_move_line).
The column contains a link to preview the PDF attachment of the invoice/vendor bill.

On a large monitor, when the preview is opened, the PDF is displayed on the right side.
When the preview is opened on a smaller display, the PDF is opened on a new browser tab.
